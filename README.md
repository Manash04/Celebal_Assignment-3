# Refactoring Callback-based Code to Async/Await

## ðŸ“‹ Assignment Objective

The goal of this assignment is to **refactor an existing codebase** that uses **callbacks** for asynchronous operations and convert it to use **Promises** and **`async/await`** for improved readability and error handling.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Description

In traditional Node.js code, asynchronous operations are often handled using **callback functions**, which can lead to complex and hard-to-read code (commonly known as "callback hell"). Modern JavaScript provides a cleaner syntax through **Promises** and **`async/await`**, enabling more maintainable and error-resilient code.

This project demonstrates a basic example of such a refactor.
